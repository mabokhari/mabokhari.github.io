    <h1>Your favourite local foodie!</h1>
    <p> I can't wait to show you my current favourite eats and coffee shops around Madison! I hope to show you more throughout the weeks but to start off strong, the links above are my top spots and my current meals I made recently as a college student. I also attached recent pictures of myself and aesthetic coffee shop locations I went to as a brief intro of what ambiance love.</p>
