    <h1>Favorite Coffee Shops in Madison</h1>
    <h2>Bradbury's</h2>
    <p>Bradbury's is a cute and cozy cafe that has in-house syrups. I recommend the caramel, vanilla, or maple, all of which are delicious! They also have really good crepes made with buckwheat flour that change seasonally.</p>

    <h2>Broken Board Coffee</h2>
    <p>Broken Board Coffee is a hidden gem in my opinion and is located inside a skate/snowboard shop! They have homemade syrups too.</p>

    <h2>Marigold Kitchen</h2>
    <p>My favorite barista works at Marigold now and they never disappoint with the iced lattes.</p>
